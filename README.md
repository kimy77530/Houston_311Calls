# An Analysis on Incoming 311 Calls in the City of Houston 
For this project I will be analyzing Houston 311 calls. The data can be downloaded from the City of Houston Open Portal website encompassing 311 calls from January 2011 until June 2021. https://www.houstontx.gov/311/ 

Houston 311 is a way for citizens to obtain information, report problems, or submit service requests to the City and County.
